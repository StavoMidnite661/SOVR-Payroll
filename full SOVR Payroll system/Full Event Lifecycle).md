ðŸ’€âš¡ Copy that, Captain â€” reformatting my last battle post + forward navigation into Gemini/Goggle CLI Directives so your crew knows exactly what to build, no filler.

ðŸŽ¯ GOGGLE CLI DIRECTIVE: Operator Dashboard Expansion (Full Event Lifecycle)

Mission: Extend the Operator Dashboard to broadcast and visualize all three stages of the payroll lifecycle â€” SalaryClaimed (onâ€‘chain), StripePayout (offâ€‘chain), and Burn (onâ€‘chain reconciliation).

Objective: Deliver a complete realâ€‘time view of each transaction lifecycle, grouped and colorâ€‘coded to show reconciliation in full.

PHASE 1: BACKEND BROADCAST EXPANSION

Task 1.1: Modify consul/consul.js to broadcast new events via WebSocket

// Add WebSocket client connection inside consul
const WebSocket = require("ws");
const ws = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:4000"); // Operator backend

function broadcast(event) {
  if (ws.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
    ws.send(JSON.stringify(event));
  }
}

// Inside SalaryClaimed handler (after payout success):
broadcast({
  id: tx.hash,
  employee: employee,
  amountUsd: usdAmount,
  type: "StripePayout",
  status: "success",
  stripeTransferId: stripeResult.transferId,
  mode: stripeResult.mode,
  timestamp: Date.now()
});

// After burn transaction:
broadcast({
  id: tx.hash,
  employee: employee,
  amountUsd: usdAmount,
  type: "Burn",
  status: "success",
  txHash: tx.hash,
  timestamp: Date.now()
});

PHASE 2: FRONTEND LIVEFEED ENHANCEMENT

Task 2.1: Update dashboard-ui/components/LiveFeed.js for multiâ€‘event icons

{e.type === "SalaryClaimed" && <span className="text-yellow-400">âš¡</span>}
{e.type === "StripePayout" && <span className="text-green-400">ðŸ’³</span>}
{e.type === "Burn" && <span className="text-red-400">ðŸ”¥</span>}


Task 2.2: Group events per lifecycle (optional enhancement)

Introduce groupId = salaryClaimTxHash field to tie payout + burn to claim.
Adjust frontend to render claims expandable, showing payout + burn beneath.
PHASE 3: TEST RUN

Task 3.1: Start operator backend

node operator-dashboard/server.js


Task 3.2: Start consul with live key

NODE_ENV=production node consul.js


Task 3.3: Trigger test claim

node scripts/triggerClaim.js --employee 0xEMPLOYEE --amount 1


Task 3.4: Observe Operator Dashboard at http://localhost:3000

âš¡ Claim appears instantly
ðŸ’³ Payout appears after Stripe confirms
ðŸ”¥ Burn appears after reconciliation
SUCCESS CRITERIA

âœ… All three events stream live into dashboard feed
âœ… Events reflect correct sequence: Claim â†’ Payout â†’ Burn
âœ… Mode shows "live" for payout proof
âœ… Operators see full lifecycle per transaction

END DIRECTIVE

ðŸ’€âš¡ Goggle CLI: Execute this plan. Broadcast expansions from Consul, expand dashboard UI for triâ€‘event sequence, prove reconciliation lifecycle in real time.

ðŸ‘‰ Captain â€” do you want me to also add Proof Artifact links (demo.log/report.json) into the Operator Dashboard UI so operators can download sealed evidence straight from the command center panel?
