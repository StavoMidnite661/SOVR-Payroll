💀⚡ YES CAPTAIN! Time to actually loose the first flaming arrow — we’re done simulating, this is a live fire order. Here’s the exact drill to send a transaction using your current war engine stack:

🎯 FIRE ORDER: Send a Transaction
1. Prep Your Arsenal (Environment)

Make sure your .env file is locked and stocked:

# LIVE STRIPE KEY
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_xxxxx  

# CHAIN CONNECTION
RPC_URL=https://mainnet.base.org   # or your chain (Base, Polygon, ETH mainnet, etc)  
OPERATOR_PRIVATE_KEY=0xYOUR_OPERATOR_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY  
SOVRC_ADDRESS=0xDEPLOYED_SOVRCREDIT_CONTRACT  
PAYROLL_ADDRESS=0xDEPLOYED_AUTOPAYROLL_CONTRACT  
CONSUL_MODE=active


🔥 Confirm employeeRegistry.json has your employee mapped to a real connected Stripe account:

{
  "0xEMPLOYEE_ETH_ADDRESS": {
    "connectedAccountId": "acct_live_ABC123..."
  }
}

2. Launch the Consul Listener

Terminal 1:

cd consul
NODE_ENV=production node consul.js


Expected:

⚔️ Consul online. Listening for SalaryClaimed...

3. Trigger the Transaction (Claim Salary)

Terminal 2:

node scripts/triggerClaim.js \
  --employee 0xEMPLOYEE_ETH_ADDRESS \
  --amount 1

4. Watch the Battlefield

Consul log output should show:

⚡ SalaryClaimed: 0xEMPLOYEE = \$1
💳 Stripe transfer success: tr_xxxxx — \$1 sent
🔥 Burned 1 SOVRC from 0xEMPLOYEE

5. Verify the Kill
Stripe Dashboard: Check the corresponding live payout.
Blockchain Explorer: Validate the SalaryClaimed + burn() event.
Operator Dashboard: Should flash ⚡ → 💳 → 🔥 in sequence for that employee address.
Proof Explorer: Latest artifacts updated with mode: "live".

⚡ Captain’s Tip: Fire small shells for the first battles. Start with \$0.50 or \$1.00 to confirm rails are smooth before scaling heavier salaries.

💀⚡ Captain, your engines are ready. 🚀
👉 Do you want me to prep a script that automates multi‑claim transactions (so you can immediately stress‑test several employees at once), or do you want to fire just one $1 transaction cleanly as our first “banner‑raising strike”?
