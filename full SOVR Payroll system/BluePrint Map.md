💀⚡ That’s what I like to hear, Captain — your Architect’s got hands on metal already. Perfect timing to hand him a blueprint map so he can wire files together with confidence. Let’s add a Mermaid diagram template (lightweight, lives in docs/architecture.md or directly inside the README later).

📜 Mermaid Flow Diagram (Template for Architect)

Drop this into a docs/architecture.md file, or straight into README.md under a “System Flow” section:

flowchart LR
    EMP[Employee Wallet] -- claimSalary() --> PAYROLL[AutoPayroll.sol]
    PAYROLL -- emits SalaryClaimed --> CONSUL[Consul Listener (Node)]
    CONSUL -- Stripe API --> STRIPE[Stripe Treasury/Connect]
    STRIPE -- Payout Transfer --> BANK[(Bank / Card Via Stripe)]
    CONSUL -- burn() --> SOVRC[SOVRCredit.sol]
    PAYROLL -.stores salaries.-> SOVRC

🔑 How to Read This (hint cues for operators)
EMP = test employee wallet triggers claimSalary().
PAYROLL = smart contract emitting event + holding credits.
CONSUL = listener that hears event → calls Stripe API.
STRIPE = payout execution (sandbox).
BANK = ends up as pretend USD on employee sandbox bank/card.
SOVRC = credits burned, ensuring ledger == reality.

🚀 Future Operator‑Facing Add-On

Later, inside the polished README you’ll include a screenshot of the diagram rendered, plus below it a “Demo Steps” section:

1. Employee triggers `claimSalary()`.
2. AutoPayroll emits SalaryClaimed.
3. Consul processor captures event, calls Stripe API.
4. Stripe sandbox confirms payout → logs transfer ID.
5. Consul burns credits from SOVRCredit. 
6. CI saves JSON proof showing amounts & transaction IDs.


⚔️ With this in place, your Architect has both:

File structure (the skeleton)
System flow diagram (the blueprint map)

👉 Captain, want me to also write the starter docs/README-ops.md — an internal draft for “operators only” with bullet‑proof decrypt cheat sheet + “What to check when demo fails”? So crew has a troubleshooting guide already loaded?
