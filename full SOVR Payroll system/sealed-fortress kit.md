💀⚡ Captain Stavo — Roger that. We’ll bake in breadcrumbs, hints, and structured how‑tos so your Architects (and future crews) never get lost — no tribal knowledge, no guesswork. When the day comes to release to the world, people will see a battle‑tested system with airtight documentation.

Here’s the complete sealed-fortress kit, with extra how‑to notes, sample outputs, and hints to guide anyone picking it up.

📜 Example Decrypted report.json

When crew decrypts after CI run, they’ll see something like:

{
  "tx_hash": "0xabc123deadbeef...",
  "employee": "0x9999deadbeef1111...",
  "claimed_usd": "500.00",
  "stripe_transfer_id": "tr_1NYxxABC123",
  "stripe_amount_usd": "500.00",
  "sovr_balance": "0", 
  "match": true
}

Hints:
tx_hash → Proof on-chain that employee claimed salary. (etherscan link on mainnet)
employee → ETH address of employee wallet.
claimed_usd → Amount emitted by AutoPayroll event.
stripe_transfer_id → Stripe payout object ID (clickable in dashboard).
sovr_balance → Remaining balance in credits after burn (e.g., 0 = fully reconciled).
match → ✅ or ❌ (true if chain and Stripe amounts match exactly).
🔑 GPG Handling Cheatsheet (for crew only)
Import Private Key (once):
gpg --import crew_secret.asc

Decrypt Logs & Report:
gh run download --name sealed-e2e-results
gpg --decrypt demo.log.encrypted > demo.log
gpg --decrypt report.json.encrypted > report.json

🛠 Local Dev Flow (Under the Radar Testing)
Spin up Docker stack:
docker-compose up --build

Deploy contracts:
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol:Deploy --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545 --private-key $DEPLOYER_PK --broadcast

Run Consul:
cd consul && node consul.js

Trigger Claim:
cast send $PAYROLL "claimSalary()" --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545 --private-key $EMPLOYEE_PK

Verify locally:
bash ci/demo.sh

📝 Release Strategy (Future)

When you finally release to the world, do this:

Strip secrets → provide .env.example.
Keep GPG layer for private logs, but maybe add a read-only public report.json (with no sensitive IDs).
Craft a public-facing README with screenshots of:
On-chain claim on Etherscan.
Stripe sandbox payout in dashboard.
Matching proof JSON.
That will be the moment the world sees steel, but your intel crew keeps the full encrypted logs inside.
⚔️ Conclusion
Now: ✅ Fortress is quiet, sealed, secure.
Crew Only: ✅ GPG encrypted artifacts + JSON proofs.
When Battle Tested: 🌍 Public release with sanitized proof.

👉 Captain, want me to also prepare a polished README.md draft (public‑facing) with diagrams + step‑by‑step demo instructions — so when the time is right, you can drop it as a “SOVR Payroll Launch Manifesto” on GitHub and blow minds?
