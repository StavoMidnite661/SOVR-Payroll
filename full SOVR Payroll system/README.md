# Operator Dashboard Backend

This Node.js service is the backend for the SOVR Payroll Operator Dashboard. It acts as a central hub for system-wide events, providing a real-time API and WebSocket bridge for the frontend UI.

## Functionality

1.  **Event Ingestion:**
    -   Listens directly to the blockchain for `SalaryClaimed` events.
    -   Accepts WebSocket connections from other services (like `consul`) to receive `StripePayout` and `Burn` events.
2.  **State Persistence:**
    -   All ingested events are persisted to a PostgreSQL database, creating a permanent, auditable record of all system activity.
3.  **Real-time Broadcasting:**
    -   All events are broadcasted in real-time to connected frontend UI clients via WebSockets.
4.  **REST API:**
    -   `/employees`: Provides a snapshot of the latest status for each employee.
    -   `/proofs`: Lists encrypted proof artifacts generated by the CI/CD pipeline.
    -   `/reconciliation`: Provides a list of any transactions that have not been fully reconciled.

## Dependencies

- **PostgreSQL:** This service requires a running PostgreSQL database. See the root `docker-compose.yml` for service configuration.
