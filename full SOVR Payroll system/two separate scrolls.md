💀⚡ Correct, Captain — two separate scrolls in the fortress archives:

This post (the Architect path):

The steel spine: folder hierarchy, ci.yml, demo.sh, Mermaid blueprint.
For your Architect + Co‑architect AI crew to build and lock the foundation.

Next scroll (Operator scroll):

A separate doc reserved for operators/human hands — no code assembly, just cheat sheets + decryption steps + how to check errors.
Call it docs/README-ops.md (operator‑ready).
Not mixed into the architect construction logs — this is strictly for the folks who will press buttons, decrypt proofs, and demo the beast without system‑level knowledge.
📜 Draft Layout for docs/README-ops.md

(this lives separately from the architect post)

# SOVR Payroll Operator Guide (Ops-Only Readme)

## 🎯 Purpose
This guide is for **operators** running demos or checking logs.
It assumes the system has already been built & deployed by Architects.

---

## 🧑‍🚀 Quick Run (Local or CI Artifact)

### 1. Trigger Payroll Claim
```bash
cast send $PAYROLL "claimSalary()" --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $EMPLOYEE_PK

2. Run Demo Script
bash ci/demo.sh

3. Get Encrypted Results (from CI run)
demo.log.encrypted = full terminal log
report.json.encrypted = machine-readable proof
🔑 Decrypting (Crew Only)

Import your secret key once:

gpg --import crew_secret.asc


Decrypt artifacts:

gpg --decrypt demo.log.encrypted > demo.log
gpg --decrypt report.json.encrypted > report.json

📄 What You Should See

demo.log:
Should show:

SalaryClaimed: $XXX
Stripe transfer success: tr_XXX
Burned XXX SOVRC

report.json:

{
  "tx_hash": "0xabc...",
  "employee": "0x999...",
  "claimed_usd": "500.00",
  "stripe_transfer_id": "tr_123...",
  "stripe_amount_usd": "500.00",
  "sovr_balance": "0",
  "match": true
}

🩸 Troubleshooting Hints
❌ Mismatch in amounts → Check employeeRegistry.json mapping.
❌ No Stripe transfer → Stripe test key expired OR Consul not running.
❌ Burn didn’t log → Operator key lacks BURNER_ROLE on SOVRCredit.
❌ Decrypt fails → Ensure you’re using crew_secret.asc private key.
🎤 In a Demo

Say out loud:

“Claim on chain → event fired → Consul picked it up → Stripe sandbox payout executed → burn reconciled → here’s JSON proof of truth.”

⚔️ That doc is kept **aside from the Architect playbook** → it’s the “human operator’s field guide.”  

👉 Captain, shall I **generate the full text of `docs/README-ops.md` now** so you can pass it *in parallel* to the operator later — or hold until your Architect confirms the skeleton files are in position?
